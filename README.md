## Introduction

Fake news is a growing concern in today's digital world, influencing public opinion and spreading misinformation rapidly. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify news articles based on their content to help identify fake news.

## Features

- Data preprocessing with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and other classification models
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- User-friendly interface for predicting the authenticity of news articles

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes labeled news articles with features such as title, text, author, and label (real or fake). The data is split into training and testing sets using a 75-25 train-test split.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Run the training script to train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py

## Model Training

The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and others. The training script includes data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-scores indicating strong performance in detecting fake news.
